# godot-3dtiles

godot-3dtiles is a plugin designed to integrate Cesium 3D Tiles format into the Godot game engine. This plugin will allow developers to load and display 3D Tiles data within Godot, easily incorporating rich geospatial data into games or applications.

## Status

The project has successfully implemented the loading of 3D Tiles from both local disk paths and HTTP server URLs. However, there are still some bugs that need to be addressed. If I have any free time, I will continue to update and improve it.
The fully functional and official version of this plugin is expected to be released in 2025, as announced on the Cesium official page. This plugin can be considered a minimal version, offering core functionalities of a 3D Tiles renderer.
Additionally, I have created a simple demo project to showcase the capabilities of this plugin. The codebase contains bugs and is somewhat cumbersome and lacking in elegance, and maybe be uploaded sometime later.
