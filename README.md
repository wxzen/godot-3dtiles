# godot-3dtiles

godot-3dtiles is a plugin designed to integrate Cesium 3D Tiles format into the Godot game engine. This plugin will allow developers to load and display 3D Tiles data within Godot, easily incorporating rich geospatial data into games or applications.

## Status

This project is currently in the development stage and has performance issues. I am actively working to optimize and improve the plugin's performance and stability. Once I have resolved the issues and thoroughly tested the codebase in real projects, I will upload the first available version.
